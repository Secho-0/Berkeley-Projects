To determine whether a particular character or string occurs in a string, you can use the in operator. If the character or string being tested is present in the string, the expression involving the in operator will return True; otherwise it will return False. For example,
>>> string = 'dead parrot'
>>> 'p' in string
True
>>> 'x' in string
False
>>> 'parrot' in string
True
