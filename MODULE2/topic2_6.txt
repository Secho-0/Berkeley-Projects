Since strings are the first true objects we've encountered in our study of Python, a brief description of functions and methods is in order.
A function is simply a way to eliminate repeated code. When a function is applied to an object, it is no longer a function but is known as a method. As of Python version 2, most important operations in strings are provided as methods.
Besides the difference in terminology, methods are invoked slightly differently than functions are.
	•	When you call a function like len, you pass the arguments in a comma-separated list surrounded by parentheses after the function name.
len(s)
	•	When you invoke a method, you provide the name of the object the method is to act upon, followed by a period, finally followed by the method name and the parenthesized list of additional arguments.
object.len()
If the method does not take any arguments, remember to provide empty parentheses, as shown above, so that Python can distinguish a method call with no arguments from a reference to a variable stored within the object.



 
If, in the subsequent commentary topics of this module I refer to methods that are not available on your system of Python, most of the same functionality is available in the string module, which I will cover in Module 8.
