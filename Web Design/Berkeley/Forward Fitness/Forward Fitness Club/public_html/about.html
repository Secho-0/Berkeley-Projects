		    <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
		    <p>The following are exercises we recommend that clients do as a part of their daily exercise routine</p>
		    <dl>
			<dt>Burpee</dt>
			<dd>Burpees are great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat 
			    and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position<br>
			<button onclick="burpeesVideo()"> See Example </button>
			</dd>

			<dt>Plank</dt>
			<dd>Planks build your core strength. To preform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. 
			    Hold the position as long as you can<br>
			<button onclick="plankVideo()"> See Example </button>
			</dd>

			<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
			<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in push up position, then bring one knee to your chest
			    and switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).<br><!-- comment -->
