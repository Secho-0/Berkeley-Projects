FINAL WARNING, TURN BACK NOW IF YOU DONT WANNA READ SOME BUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLSHIT. BUT SERIOUSLY THIS GETS FUCKING BAD QUICKLY TURN BACK NOW IF YOU DONT WANNA FUCK YOURSELVES UP



Okay so, outside of the group of people involved. you are the only ones to get this much detail into this part of my life. Ive repressed uhhh a lot of this, but its because of this absolutely horrific bullshit i had to slog through when i was 14 that made me into the person i am now... I had a lot to undo because of this, but in the end its helped me become who I am.

People :
Jason - my best friend whom ive mentioned , 14-15 for most of this 
Jake - Me 14 for this 
Dani - One of my friends in high school, dating jason for most of this  14-15 for most of this 
Courtney - My first girlfriend (well that tells you where this is gonna go lol) 13-14 for the course of this 
Jay - White, 20 y/o guy 
Owen - Black 20-21 y/o Adopted brother of Jay , Brain Damaged (well get there) 
Emily - Owens Daughter(kinda? well get there.. this is why the skin tones matter.) , 6 y/o for the duration of this
Rena - Jays blood sister, also a crackwhore - her words. brief involvement but i hate not being able to mention names if i can remember so she gets a spot too

So to paint the scene on my end: 
I had just finished moving to Calgary the year before roughly. it was the near-end summer of my transition into highcshool when I got together with Courtney. Was pretty awesome for the first little while and then i learn her ex Jay is messaging her, so i try and figure out whats going on... Eventually Dani - whom i had grown close with over the summer as well and I both started talking to him and trying to figure out what all was happening and going on... and eventually Jason joined as well, i wish i could tell you when. but I do know he knows just as much cause we at one point had to catch him up to speed.... 


This is where things start to break in my memory so Ill tell you how things went. Any and all conversations i talk about took place over Windows Live Messenger / MSN Messenger a few times over cam but mainly over text. 

So to just GO cause im horrible at starting, were gonna just launch into this. Courtney was kinda, well sick. but my dipshit ass didnt understand that wanting a kid at 13 wasnt exactly normal. WELL i learned why, Jay had raped Courtney 14 times in the back of his pickup truck. that... that makes sense.. but wait theres more! on top of that he also used MDMA to dope her up and also give abortions any time it was necessary, just to ensure that he couldnt get in trouble.

Along the way, usually when Jay was too high on meth and/or heroin, his brother Owen would take over. Owen was a drug dealer - his brothers supplier, gang banger, and brain damaged because Jay decided to preform surgery on own to help him forget ruining Jays life, if im recalling correctly also at Owens request. 

So to get into that story....This is where shits gonna get F U K T right quick. so.... LEGGO I GUESS.  back when Jay and Owen were about 16-17, Owen was learning to drive, or rather had just gotten his drivers and well, Owen hit Jay bad enough, that his brain damage prevented him from getting his fullride through medschool. However Jay and retained enough of his smarts to still retain information and learn fairly well about most  things. Including those nessary to operate. 

In fact he remembered enough about operating on people that he decided eventually that he should be fine to start testing that out. Makes sense right? So thats where i learned that Jay had a house away from his place in Chestermere (where I live now) out in Cochrane (Other side of Calgary, and north a little from where i live).... Where amongst other collections he had 52 Pairs of human eyeballs. and was working on collecting more. So like i was getting to prior to explaining the entirety of Jays fucked up situation... because Jay had studied a bit of medschool prior to the accident , or enough to understand the sheer concept of what needed to be done. So, he just... removed a part of Owens brain . Cause thats what you do when people want to forget things right? just REMOVE A PART OF THEIR FUCKING BODY, LET ALONE the AND I MEAN the ORGAN RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURE GOD DAMN EXISTANCE...
Ohh and there was one time that Rena camgirled over MSN for $5. Thats a whole different problem, but about a week after that Jay decided it was okay enough to kill her given the way her life was going. so thats a thing to. 

So moving on from the background on how we got to know Jay and Owen, as well as who they are. Lets move onto Emily. So im going to keep this brief because well lets be honest. Hearing what im about describe about a fucking 6 year old is just outright depressing, and horrible. But i may need to provide context in some areas.

So Jay and Owen are adopted brothers, and Owen - post op - had a girlfriend, and well along with everything else wonderful about Jay he cheated with Owens Girlfriend. and this pregnancy happened before all of the bullshit above so y'know... The kid was born. and thats Emily.. And given the rest of Jays life i just rolled with the punches so-to-speak... and didnt quesiton the ages cause at this rate having a kid when he was like 13 seemed entirely fucking plausible 

Well at this point emily is hyper aware of her surroundings and about as smart as her dad, so on top of being exposed to this stuff on the dailly basis and believe me, she was exposed. we had to deal with this kid a lot more than not. The child has now seen Jay hurt himself... BADLY , like... you know the saying "Down the road not across the street"? if not. its because you want to cut down your arms, not across them. You have MUCH higher chance of hitting an artery or vein and bleeding out... but given Jays medical knowledge he could do that and then just stitch himself up... 

This lead to Emily having multiple attempts at going across the street (THANK GOD) and eventually learning that down the road makes more of an impact (but Jay would get mad so she didnt). One time Emily stabbed right through her arm with a steak knife, so me Jason and Dani had to get them to call an ambulence , but they at first refused because Owen was Higher than a fucking kite (he broke rule #1 of dealing, he got high on his own supply).... Eventually they did though thank god 

The grand finale to this, is that all these years and years later.... I have no idea if any of these people are real or what happened to emily. I dont know if i got catfished, i dont know if a pedo used and abused my first girlfriend, idk if there was once a serial killer in the town i live in 



Thats why im upset about what happened with moon. Thats why im trying not to talk shit about that person. No matter how much every bone in my body is screaming to... even now. Thats why i got mad. I can not fathom what fucked up shit has to be occuring in anyones mind to drive them to fake anything like that. 

Welcome to my fucked up life. Genuinely, im glad youre here. 

I love you guys. Im tearing up so ima just say that and wrap this up. 
(the tears are cause im nervous and just really happy i got a chance to type this, which wouldnt of happened without you guys)
