Python was designed foremost as an interactive language. When you're using Python's interactive mode, statements are executed once you type them in, and the results of expressions you type are immediately printed.
	•	On UNIX systems, you can type "python" at the UNIX prompt to enter the basic Python interpreter.
	•	Under Windows or UNIX, you can use the Integrated Development environment known as "IDLE" to easily access Python.
You can terminate your interactive session with an end-of-file character.
Running a Python Program under Windows
The easiest way to run a Python program under Windows is to use the IDLE program editor to create a file with a ".py" extension.
You can navigate to IDLE by going to the IDLE entry of the Python submenu in the Programs folder of your Start menu. You can find the idle.pyw program and execute it directly. When IDLE starts up, it presents you with a "Python shell" into which you can interactively type Python commands.
Alternatively, you can use IDLE's editor to create a file containing your Python program. Once you've created and saved a file under IDLE, you can then click on the icon for that file (which should be a smiling Python) to execute the program.
If your Python program produces any printed output, a window will open, display the output, and immediately disappear.
Running a Python Program under UNIX
A standard technique for running programs written in a language such as Python on a UNIX system is to include a special line at the beginning of your programming that informs the operating system where it can find the Python interpreter. So, the first line in your Python program should look like this:
#!/usr/bin/env python
After placing the above line in your program, you need to mark the file as executable with the following command:
chmod +x filename
where filename is the name of the file containing your Python program. Now you can execute your program by simply typing its name at the UNIX prompt.
