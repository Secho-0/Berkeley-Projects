You can extract one or more characters from a string using subscripts. Subscripts are placed in square brackets after the string; a single subscript extracts a single letter. When using subscripts, remember that the first letter of a string has an index of 0, not 1.
>>>string = 'the quick brown fox'
>>> string[0]
't'
>>> string[4]
'q' 
Negative subscripts are counted from the end of the string, with -1 representing the last character.
>>>string
'the quick brown fox'
>>> string[-1]
'x'
>>> string[-5]
'n'
You can obtain the number of characters in a string by using the len() function.
>>>len(string)
19



 
Remember that the index of the final element of a string will always be one less than the string's length, since the first character of a string has an index of 0.
