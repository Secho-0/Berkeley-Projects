When you use Python through the interpreter or the IDLE program, the statements you type are immediately executed, and, unless you assign a value to a variable, the value is echoed on the screen. This makes Python very convenient to use as a calculator. You can enter values directly or store them in variables.
>>> width = 2.5
>>> height = 3.7
>>> area = 2.5 * 3.7
>>> area
9.25
>>> 2.5 * 3.7
9.25
>>> width * height
9.25
